# Memory Promoter

Reviews `memory/staging/` for topics referenced across 3+ distinct days and promotes them to `wiki/1 Projects/` (project notes). Session summary promotion requires manual agent judgment using the candidate report.

## When to use

- User asks "anything in staging worth promoting?"
- User asks "clean up my staging notes"
- User asks "what topics keep coming up?"
- During session wrap-up or weekly review

## Workflow

### 1. Dry-run (default — report only)

```bash
python scripts/workspace/memory-promoter.py
```

Prints a table of promotion candidates: topic, mention count, and whether already promoted. No files are created.

### 2. Promote (auto-create wiki project notes)

```bash
python scripts/workspace/memory-promoter.py --promote
```

Creates `wiki/1 Projects/<topic>/00 Top Note.md` for candidates that aren't already promoted.

### 3. Review the report

The report is written to `memory/staging/promotion-candidates-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Read it to see what was promoted.

## How it works

- Scans all `memory/staging/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files (skips `README.md`, `health-check-*`, and `promotion-candidates-*`)
- Extracts topics from: `##` headings, wikilinks (`[[...]]`), project references (`project: X`), and backlinks (`see also: X`)
- Counts distinct days each topic appears
- Topics appearing on 3+ distinct days are candidates
- `--promote` creates a minimal wiki top note for each candidate

## Promotion criteria

A staging entry should be promoted when it:
- References the same project/topic across 3+ distinct days
- Has enough context to form a project note or session summary
- Isn't already tracked in `wiki/1 Projects/` or `memory/sessions/` (the script checks this mechanically)
- Is still relevant and actionable (agent judgment required)

The script handles the mechanical check; the agent should still exercise judgment before promoting (e.g., checking if the topic is still relevant).
