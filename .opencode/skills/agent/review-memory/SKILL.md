# Memory Review

## When to use

User says "review my sessions", "analyze memory", "find patterns", "what can be automated", or periodically when enough sessions have accumulated.

## Workflow

### 1. Scan sessions

Read session summaries from `memory/sessions/`. Look at the most recent chunk (e.g., last 5-10 sessions, last week, or whatever the user specifies).

### 2. Identify patterns

Look for:

| Pattern | Signals |
|---------|---------|
| **Repeated manual steps** | Same commands, same file edits, same workflows appearing across sessions |
| **Recurring questions** | User asks similar things across multiple sessions |
| **Multi-step workflows** | Sequences that span sessions but lack a structured guide |
| **Untracked context** | Information the agent had to re-discover or ask the user for each session |
| **Tool gaps** | Operations that required awkward workarounds or multiple tool calls |

### 3. Write findings

Create `memory/reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`:

```md
# Memory Review: <date range>

## Candidates for skills

<Patterns that could become their own .opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md.>
Each: what the skill would do, trigger phrases, source session.

## Candidates for commands

<Patterns that suit a slash-command or alias.>

## Candidates for plugins

<Patterns complex enough to need a plugin.>

## Memory gaps

<Information that future sessions will need and should be persisted to memory/index.md.>

## Index update suggestions

<Proposed additions to memory/index.md based on this review.>
```

### 4. Offer to act

After presenting findings, ask the user which candidates they want to build. Use `create-skill` for skill candidates, or scaffold commands/plugins as appropriate.

## Rules

- Focus on actionable patterns, not just descriptive summaries.
- Reference specific session files for each finding.
- Rank candidates by impact (how many sessions would benefit).
