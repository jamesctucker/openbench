# Setup

Before any design work or file edits:

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md) via the loader script.
2. Identify the register and load the matching register reference (brand.md or product.md).
3. **If the user invoked a sub-command (e.g. `craft`, `shape`, `audit`), load its reference file too.** This is non-negotiable: `craft` without `craft.md` loaded means you'll skip the shape-and-confirm step the user expects.

Skipping these produces generic output that ignores the project.

## 1. Context gathering

Two files, case-insensitive. The loader looks at the project root by default and falls back to `.agents/context/` and `docs/` if the root is clean. Override with `IMPECCABLE_CONTEXT_DIR=path/to/dir` (absolute or relative to cwd).

- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. Colors, typography, elevation, components.

Load both in one call:

```bash
node .opencode/skills/design/impeccable/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Consume the full JSON output. Never pipe through `head`, `tail`, `grep`, or `jq`. The output's `contextDir` field tells you where the files were resolved from.

If the output is already in this session's conversation history, don't re-run. Exceptions requiring a fresh load: you just ran `/impeccable teach` or `/impeccable document` (they rewrite the files), or the user manually edited one.

`/impeccable live` already warms context via `live.mjs`. If you've run `live.mjs`, don't also run `load-context.mjs` this session.

If PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars): run `/impeccable teach`, then resume the user's original task with the fresh context. If the original task was `/impeccable craft`, resume into `/impeccable shape` before any implementation work.

If DESIGN.md is missing: nudge once per session (*"Run `/impeccable document` for more on-brand output"*), then proceed.

## 2. Register

Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, long-form content, portfolio: design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, admin, dashboard, tool: design SERVES the product).

Identify before designing. Priority: (1) cue in the task itself ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) the surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md. First match wins.

If PRODUCT.md lacks the `register` field (legacy), infer it once from its "Users" and "Product Purpose" sections, then cache the inferred value for the session. Suggest the user run `/impeccable teach` to add the field explicitly.

Load the matching reference: [brand.md](brand.md) or [product.md](product.md).
